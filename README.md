# reviewer_response

This generates a slick response summary HTML from a Google sheet used for peer review reponse triage

Your google sheet must have the following columns

- Reviewer
- ReviewerImportance
- Request
- Difficulty
- Response (can contain anchor tags that refer to identifiers for other items e.g. #87LE )
